This module extends 'partner_delivery_zone' module with the aim to manage sales orders in a way
to organize for delivery. Add a few views and tools to help in this point of view.

In Odoo normal way is to organize the delivery of the sales from de Inventory app. But in this case
previously to the picking, from sales,  you need to organize and show how would be the delivery.
